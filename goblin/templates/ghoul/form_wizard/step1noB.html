<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> This tool does not migrate any email thatâ€™s currently stored in your ONID mailbox. We will provide an email migration tool late in the Summer 2013 term. This means that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You will need to access your old ONID mailbox to access old messages, AND</li>
    <li>You will need to access your new ONID mailbox on Google to access new messages</li>
</ul>

<p>You may find it more convenient to wait to transition when the migration tool is ready for you. We will make an announcement when that tool is ready.</p>

<p>{{ form.transition }}
I understand that by transitioning to Google Mail now, any email currently stored in my ONID mailbox will not be migrated to Google.</p>
<p>{{ form.transition.errors }}</p>

<p>{{ form.migration }}
I understand that a migration tool will be provided late in the Summer 2013 term and I do not wish to wait for that tool, as I wish to begin using Google Mail now.</p>
<p>{{ form.transition.errors }}</p>
