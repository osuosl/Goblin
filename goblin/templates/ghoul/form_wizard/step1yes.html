<p>Are you ready to move your ONID mailbox over to Google Apps for OSU? If yes, this Email Migration Opt-In tool will help you move your messages into Google.</p>

<p>Following the end of this process, you will use Google to check your ONID email rather than the ONID mailbox that you currently use.</p>

<p>When you click on the “Continue” button below, we will take you through a few screens to make sure your mailbox is completely prepared for migration. As you run through these screens, you will have the option of cancelling the migration if you decide you are not ready.</p>

<div class="form-actions form-wrapper" id="edit-actions">
   <input name="wizard_goto_step" class="form-submit" style="margin-top: 0; " type="submit" value="Continue" />
   <a type="button" class="btn btn-large" href="https://oregonstate.edu" style="text-decoration: none;">
    Cancel Opt-In Migration</a>
