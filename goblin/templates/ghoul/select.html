Welcome to the PSU Email Migration opt-in tool. 
This tool is designed to synchronize your email data on PSUâ€™s servers (messages and folder structure) 
with your account in Google Apps. 
Once they are in sync the tool will finish the process by updating our records to route your 
mail through the Google Apps @ PSU mail system.</p>
<p>
Once you click Opt-in, you can safely close this page or revisit it to check on the progress. </p>

<p>
Warning: Mail maintenance (moving/deleting folders, purging messages) can delay or even foul your migration. 
If you need to perform such actions, please do so then revisit this page in a few days. 
Do NOT do these types of actions while the tool is working. </p>

<br>
<b>IMPORTANT: Before opting-in to Google Mail be sure that you understand the items below:</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>While this process typically takes between 10 minutes and 1 hour to complete, it can take up to 48 hours.  
During this process, you can continue to use your current mail setup.  You will receive a final email in your 
PSU mailbox when the migration has finished along with your next steps.

<li>Email Clients (i.e. Thunderbird, Outlook, and iPhone/Android mail apps) will need to be reconfigured once the process is complete. 
Instructions on how to do this can be found on the OIT website, 
in addition a link to the page will be sent to you in the Completion Email. 
<b>Be aware the best experience is had through the Google Mail web app - commonly referred to as Gmail.</b>

<li>Email forwarding (if configured in OAM or Webmail) will stop, and any existing mail filters & rules will need to be configured in Google Mail.

<li>Shared email folders will not be accessible once converted to Google Mail.

<li>Upon engaging the opt-in tool Mail will be available within Google Apps. Do NOT interact with it until you receive the completion emails.

<li>This process can not be reversed. You will be on Google Mail permanently.
</ul>
